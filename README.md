## Progressive Enhancement for Value Communication

An interactive React component demonstrating the principles of progressive enhancement applied to value communication systems.

## Overview

This application visualizes a four-phase approach to building resilient value communication systems:

1. **Foundation** - Structure and Content
2. **Enhancement** - Visual Design and Basic Interactivity
3. **Sophistication** - Advanced Features (With Fallbacks)
4. **Optimization** - Refinement and Error Proofing

Each phase builds upon the previous ones, creating layers that can gracefully degrade when technical constraints are encountered.

## Features

- Interactive phase selection
- Feature availability toggles to simulate different scenarios
- Visual representation of traditional vs. emergent value creation models
- Detailed explanations of implementation approaches for each phase
